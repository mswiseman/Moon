# This is a work in progress, please come back

## I do a lot of repetitive things in the name of science

And if you're here, I'm guessing you do too. One process I've probably done 10,000+ times is setting up a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This winter, before my comparative genomics class, I was talking for my professor, Dr. Aaron Liston, about how many plates I needed to run just to get pre-liminary data for my *MLO* work(~50). He suggested I look into robotics. **Of course**! How had this maker not considered that? So, I scoured all sects of internet and came across numerous examples of scientists all of the world building their own liquid handlers (each with varying levels of documentation).

Opentrons was probably the first fully open automatic liquid handler. They debuted back in 2015 with a [kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/932664050/opentrons-open-source-rapid-prototyping-for-biolog). Their original OT-one design has X, Y1, Y2, Z, and A axes (A is for the pipette, which is driven by an non-captive nema stepper motor).
