On Science Communication
=======================
Replications are a critical consideration when making statistical interferences.  As such, much of my time in the wet lab involves engaging in a repetitive task, such as setting up repeat qPCR runs to examine run-to-run variance. During these repititive tasks I take a systematic and sequential approach:

1. Type a step-wise plan
2. Print out my plan
3. Organize necessary supplies
4. Turn on noise cancelling headphones
5. Tune in to my favorite podcasters

Didn't see that last step coming, did you? Well, this is about science-communication, not methods (though I do encourage new students to follow a similar approach).

One of my favorite podcasts, [ShortWave](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510351/short-wave), airs easy-to-digest scientific stories all while promoting diversity and   encouraging forward-thinking. This past week, I was *thoroughly impressed* by their story on [Dr. Jess Wade](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/04/953334366/one-page-at-a-time-jess-wade-is-changing-wikipedia), an experimental physicist who writes Wikipedia pages on female and POC scientists in her spare time. At the time the story aired, Dr. Jess Wade had already written over 1200 Wikipedia pages for these underrepresented groups.

This feat is absolutely incredible and undeniabily helps uplift female and POC scientists by making their scientific achievements more accessible to the public. Go ahead and google `Rosalind Franklin`. What pops up first? 

**Wikipedia**

Bottom line: **If there is a Wikipedia page for your search, it is usually your top search result.** This isn't unique to just biographical searches, it also applies to other important topics, such as *your research subject*. Once again, why do we care?

From the [ShortWave](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510351/short-wave) transcript:

```
KWONG: Wikipedia sees 300 billion page views every day on average and has 
the power to influence the direction of scientific research.

WADE: So if a research topic or a particular kind of emerging interdisciplinary
area is well written about and well documented on Wikipedia, that will grow and
blossom. People will be attracted to and read that. You know, chemists who read 
pages about cool new chiral molecules will further develop those chiral 
molecules because they'll have read this kind of introduction.
```

So, trying to get that *obscure research subject* proposal funded? Aside from a proposal, put together a Wiki page, expand a current one, simply the language, etc. to make the information more accessable. 

Putting my money where my mouth is...
-------------------------------------
![My recent Wikipedia contributions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mswiseman/mswiseman.github.io/master/assets/img/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-12%20at%205.11.35%20PM.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

I found little or erroraneous information when I went looking for the research topics we cover in the [Gent Lab](https://gentlab.github.io). So, I've taken to correcting these errors and have started expanding on some of our more obscure research. I have more to do; however, as I have always said about writing, it's best to start by just putting words down and then build from there. 

Make a WikiPage and go promote your science!
