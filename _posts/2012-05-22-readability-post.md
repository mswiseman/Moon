Replications are a critical consideration when making statistical interferences.  As such, much of my time in the wet lab involves engaging in a repetitive task, such as setting up repeat qPCR runs to examine run-to-run variance. During these repititive tasks I take a systematic and sequential approach:

1. Type a step-wise plan
2. Print out my plan
3. Organize necessary supplies
4. Turn on noise cancelling headphones
5. Tune in to my favorite podcasters

Didn't see that last step coming, did you? Well, this is about science-communication, not methods (though I do encourage new students to follow a similar approach).

One of my favorite podcasts, [ShortWave](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510351/short-wave), airs easy-to-digest scientific stories all while promoting diversity and   encouraging forward-thinking. This past week, I was thoroughly impressed by their story on [Dr. Jess Wade](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/04/953334366/one-page-at-a-time-jess-wade-is-changing-wikipedia), an experimental physicist who writes Wikipedia pages on female and POC scientists in her spare time. At the time the story aired, Dr. Jess Wade had already written over 1200 Wikipedia pages for these underrepresented groups.
