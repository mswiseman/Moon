## ExifR

Does your research involve extensive geospacial imaging? If so, you might be interested in learning how to automatically retrieve GPS (and other) metadata from your photos using the handy R package [exifr](https://github.com/paleolimbot/exifr). This is a brief example on how to generate a metadata table from your iphone photos. 


1. Set your working directory to wherever your photos of interest are. 
```{r}
#setwd("~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters/2021/05")       #Uncomment and change to your directory

````
Next, install and then load the required packages. 

```r
install.packages("dplyr")      #comment out if you have the package
install.packages("exifr")       #comment out if you have the package
install.packages("leaflet")     #comment out if you have the package

library(dplyr)    
library(leaflet)            
library(exifr)
```

Create a list of your .jpg files. Determine what metadata you want and customize it after the read_exif command. Different metadata options depend on what metadata your camera captures; however, the packages options can be found [here](https://github.com/paleolimbot/exifr). 

```r
files <- list.files(pattern = "*.JPG", recursive = TRUE)        #I've set mine to recursive as I have many subdirectories. * = wildcard.
dat <- read_exif(files, tags = c("filename", "DateTimeOriginal", "GPSLongitude","GPSLatitude","GPSTimeStamp"))     #Customize the metadata of interest in the parentheses
```

With your metadata labeled and loaded into a dataframe, you can now export it as a .csv or use the metadata with a package like leaflet (and openstreetmaps).
