# DIY Hardware in the Plant Sciences

I hope this website can be a resource for anyone looking into DIY open-source hardware or software for their research. Broadly speaking, my research primarily involves plant sciences and plant pathology; as such, resources found here will initially be focused on hardware and software potentially or currenlty relevant to research in the plant sciences. However, lab hardware and software often transcends disciplines, so I hope you can find useful information regardless of your field. I am not an engineer, so I've tried to tread light in areas in which my terminology and/or understanding may not be accurate or thorough. Regardless, I hope you won't discouraged by any initial difficulties as there are many resources available and people who want to see you succeed. Nobody is all-knowing and everyone has to start somewhere. Let's create a collaborative and supportive DIY movement in the plant sciences together.

## Why join the DIY free open source movement?

* Improve accessibility
* Custimize and/or build automation for repetitive tasks
* Improve intra- and inter-lab reproducibility
* Learn critical troubleshooting, coding, and electrical skills
* Build the socially-acceptable version of adult legos (okay, that's a joke)

## Resources
**Interested? I hope so! Here are some great resources to start:**

* [Peer-reviewed scientific resources](#peer-reviewed-scienfic-resources)
* [Selected publications](#selected-publications)
* [Hardware documentation](#hardware-documentation)
    * [Microcontrollers](#microcontrollers)
    * [Stepper drivers](#stepper-drivers)
    * [Environmental sensors](#environmental-sensors)
* [Exceptional YouTube tutorials](#youtube-tutorials)
* [Recommendations on where to purchase components](#purchasing-recommendations)
* [Local resources for Oregon State University](#local-resources)
* [Insightful links](#insightful-links)

## Peer-reviewed scienfic resources
<img align="left" width="100" alt="HardwareX Logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mswiseman/mswiseman.github.io/master/assets/img/hardwarexlogo.gif"> [HardwareX](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/hardwarex) is a peer-reviewed open access scientific journal dedicated to the open source design and construction of scientific instrumentation. The journal publishes science hardware shared under an open source hardware license. For DIY hardware, I believe HardwareX has the most detailed manuscripts that enable easier reproducibility. <br clear="left"/><br><br>

<img align="left" width="100" alt="Nature Scientific Reports Logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mswiseman/mswiseman.github.io/master/assets/img/ScientificReportsandNatureLogo.png"> [Nature Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/srep/) is an open access journal publishing original research from across all areas of the natural sciences, medicine and engineering. To find manuscripts more likely to have DIY hardware, I would explore the tags [*lab-on-a-chip*](https://www.nature.com/search?q=lab-on-a-chip&order=relevance&journal=srep), [*biomedical engineering*](https://www.nature.com/search?q=biomedical%20engineering&order=relevance&journal=srep), or [*mechanical engineering*](https://www.nature.com/search?q=mechanical%20engineering&order=relevance&journal=srep). <br clear="left"/><br><br>

## Hardware documentation

I've included direct links to the documentation of hardware commonly used in DIY free open source hardware. This field is rapidly evolving, so I imagine this section will change frequently. 

### Microcontrollers

Microcontrollers are the brains of hardware - they tell the other components what to do. They are best suited for singular repetitive tasks (such as activating a motor). I recommend choosing a microcontroller not only based on your power and accessory needs, but as based on the reputation and available documentation. Speaking from experience: you will save yourself a lot of frustration if you work with a microcontroller that has thorough documentation (like the Arduino series). 

#### CNC
Have a task that can be programmed and contained on an X, Y, Z system? You'll probably use computer numerical control (CNC). These microcontrollers have firmware that's adapted for and commonly used in CNC applications (CNC routers, 3d printers, liquid handlers, etc.):
* [Arduino Uno (8-bit)](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3)
* [Ardunio Nano (8-bit)](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-nano)
* [Arduino Mega (8-bit)](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/mega-2560-r3)
* [Arduino Due (32-bit)](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/due)
* [Duet2 (32-bit)](https://www.duet3d.com/DuetWifi)
* [Due5x (32-bit)[]
* [Smoothieboard (32-bit)](http://smoothieware.org/)

#### Wearable-friendly
* [Seeeduino XIAO](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-Arduino-Microcontroller-SAMD21-Cortex-M0+-p-4426.html)
* []()

### Microcontroller firmware

* [Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/)
    * [All compatible boards](https://marlinfw.org/docs/hardware/boards.html)
* [RepRap](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap)
    * [Compatible 8/16-bit boards](https://reprap.org/wiki/Category:8/16-bit_board)
    * [Compatible 32-bit boards](https://reprap.org/wiki/Category:32-bit_board) 
* [Smoothieware](https://smoothieware.org/)
    * Compatible with all RepRap boards

### Stepper drivers

### Environmental sensors

### Mini-computers
Technically speaking, mini-computers (aka microprocessors) are not microcontrollers as they can handle multiple tasks at once. These are best suited for software heavy applications.
