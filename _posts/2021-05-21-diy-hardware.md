**Can you break down tasks or processes from your research into simple, step-wise parts? Do you have processes that sequentially build off of previous steps? Does your work involve gathering multiple types of environmental data at regular increments? If so, you might consider exploring DIY software and/or hardware for your laboratory.**

## Background

This website is a resourse for anyone interested in DIY **f**ree and **o**pen **s**ource **h**ardware and **s**oftware (FOSH and FOSS) for their plant science research. <br><br>I am **not** an engineer and thus I have tried to tread lightly in areas for which my terminology and/or understanding may not be accurate or thorough. Sometimes exploring a new skill or field can be frustrating or intimidating, especially early in the process; to overcome this, I encourage you to seek help from people who have more experience and from the many other resources available (videos, documentation, forums, books, etc.). Keep in mind: nobody is all-knowing and everyone has to start somewhere; alas, let's foster a collaborative and supportive DIY movement together!

## Why DIY FOSH and FOSS?

If your lab is fortunate enough to be flush with funding, you may be asking: why bother building something myself when I can pay a company to do it for me? Great question. This may not be relevant for you. However, you may still find other benefits by learning how to build hardware and software yourself. Some benefits include:

* Improving accessibility to underfunded laboratories
* Creating customization and/or automation for repetitive tasks
* Improving intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility
* Learning critical troubleshooting, coding, and electrical skills
* Getting paid to build the socially-acceptable version of adult legos (:smirk:)

## Resources

**Interested in learning more? I hope so!** I encourage you to first review the selected publications below as I believe they have exceptional documentation and show the breadth of possible applications. While purusing the published, peer-examples, think about similarities and differences between your work processes and the published work: does your research have similiar tasks or processes? If so, a good place to start is by learning more about the hardware and software implemented in the paper of interest. If electronic wiring and microcontrollers are new to you, you should then consider exploring a DIY kit before starting on a larger project - this will greatly reduce frustration later on by building troubleshooting skills in low stakes situations (versatile kits [here](https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Project-Tutorial-Controller-Projects/dp/B01D8KOZF4/), [here](https://www.amazon.com/Arduino-Starter-Kit-English-Official/dp/B009UKZV0A/).

## Free and open source software
[Back to top](#resources)

Free and open-source software (FOSS) enable unrestrained reuse and modifaction of a software's source code. Linux OS and Mozilla Firefox are classic examples of FOSS that enjoy widespread usage. There's a great list of open CAM/CNC software [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hobbycnc/comments/aj0hu8/list_of_free_and_open_source_camcnc_software/).

## Hardware documentation
[Back to top](#resources)

I've included direct links to the documentation of hardware commonly used in DIY free open source hardware. This field is rapidly evolving, so I imagine this section will change frequently. 

### Microcontrollers

[Microcontrollers](https://makezine.com/2016/09/06/12-specs-to-consider-when-choosing-a-microcontroller-for-your-product/) are the brains of hardware - they tell the other components what to do. They are best suited for simple repetitive tasks (such as activating a motor). I recommend choosing a microcontroller based on your power needs, programming language preference (generally C or micropython), peripherals, and based on the company's reputation and the available documentation. Speaking from experience: you will save yourself *a lot of frustration* if you work with a microcontroller that has thorough documentation and support (like the Arduino series).

### Microcontroller firmware
Firmware is essentially permanent software that is programmed to microcontrollers. You will need to change the firmware (or write your own) to adapt it for your application; consequently, it's wise to familiarize yourself with the available resources, formatting, and limitations of various firmware packages. Firmware is typically written in C, C++, or Micropython. The software component of DIY hardware *can be challenging*, **but** there are tools, such as integrated development environments (IDE), that can make customizing firmware fairly straightforward. Not familiar with IDE? If you have used R-Studio or Jupyter Notebook, then you have used IDEs for the R and Python, respectively. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ana1mFFMHIk) a nice overview of IDEs.

### Stepper drivers
Stepper motors are the most type of common motor deployed in high-precision CNC-type applications. Stepper motors work move in a precise, incremental, step-wise fashion (thorough review [here](https://www.motioncontrolproducts.com/applications/selection-guide-for-stepper-motors/)). Stepper drivers are components that *drive* stepper motors.  Stepper drivers are often integrated into microcontroller boards, but can also be wired externally. When choosing a stepper driver, one needs to consider how powerful their stepper motors are, what extra features they would like, and how precise they need their stepper motor to be. Good overviews can be found [here](https://all3dp.com/2/what-s-a-stepper-motor-driver-why-do-i-need-it/), [here](https://3daddict.com/stepper-driver-comparison-3d-printer-upgrade/), and [here](https://www.drdflo.com/pages/Guides/How-to-Build-a-3D-Printer/Stepper-Driver.html).

### Environmental sensors
Microcontrollers and microprocessors are well suited for environmental sensing; as such, many accessory modules have been developed and able to detect air movement, humidity, temperature, light, vibration, sound, etc. If you're an OSU researcher and have a project involving environmental sensing, reach out to the [OPEnS Lab](https://open-sensing.org/) - this is their specialty. If not, I've provided some resources below.

* [Low-cost electronic sensors for environmental research: Pitfalls and opportunities](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0309133320956567)
* [HardwareX special issue on environmental sensing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/hardwarex/special-issue/10GZTLV8SHB)

### Microprocessors
Technically speaking, microprocessors (aka mini-computers) are not microcontrollers as they can handle multiple tasks at once. These are best suited for software-heavy applications or as a computer that controls multiple microcontrollers.

## Purchasing recommendations

Regardless of who you buy from, most of your hardware components will be manufactured in China; alas, it is tempting to get the best price and buy from alibaba. Unfortunately, when you buy an open-source chip from alibaba or another third party seller, you are likely not supporting the developers who put time and energy into developing open-source hardware. If you have the financial means to pay slightly more to support open source developers, please do. Not only will you help support the movement, but also exchanges are easier and you typically recieve much better technical support. Further, there have been reports of shortcuts in ripoff hardware that have lead to safety hazards not present in original genuine open source release.  Nonetheless, open source is open source, so if your lab is in the dire straights, aliexpress will almost always be the cheapest option.
