**I want you to stop and ask yourself: does your work involve protocols that are broken-down into simple, stepwise parts? Do you have processes that sequentially builds off of previous steps? Does your work involve gathering multiple types of environmental data at regular increments? If so, you might consider exploring DIY software and/or hardware for your laboratory.**

## Background

I made this website as a resource for anyone looking into DIY open-source hardware or software for their research. Broadly speaking, my research involves plant sciences and pathology; consequently, resources found here will initially be focused on hardware and software relevant to the plant sciences. However, lab hardware and software often transcend disciplines, so I hope you can find useful information regardless of your field. <br><br>I am **not** an engineer and thus I have tried to tread lightly in areas for which my terminology and/or understanding may not be accurate or thorough. Sometimes exploring a new skill or field can be frustrating or intimidating, especially early in the process; to overcome this, I encourage you to seek help from people who have more experience and from the many other resources available (videos, documentation, forums, etc.). Keep in mind: nobody is all-knowing and everyone has to start somewhere; alas, let's create a collaborative and supportive DIY movement together!

## Why DIY hardware/software?

If your lab is fortunate enough to be flush with funding, you may be asking: why bother building something myself when I can pay a company to do it for me? Great question. This may not be relevant for you. However, you may still find other benefits by learning how to build hardware and software yourself. Some benefits include:

* Improving accessibility to underfunded laboratories
* Creating customization and/or automation for repetitive tasks
* Improving intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility
* Learning critical troubleshooting, coding, and electrical skills
* Building the socially-acceptable version of adult legos (okay, that's a joke)

## Resources \ [Back to top](#background)
**Interested in learning more? I hope so!** I encourage you to first look over the selected publications below as I believe they do an exceptional job with documentation and also show the wide range of applications for free open source hard and software in the laboratory. While purusing the published, peer-examples, think about similarities and differences between your work processes and the published work: does your research have similiar tasks or processes? If so, a good place to start is by learning more about the hardware and software implemented in the paper of interest. If electronic wiring and microcontrollers are new to you, you should then consider exploring a DIY kit (versatile kits [here](https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Project-Tutorial-Controller-Projects/dp/B01D8KOZF4/ref=zg_bs_17441247011_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=BBWW093183JGAM3DA6D6), [here](), and [here]()) before starting on a larger project - this will greatly reduce frustration later on by building troubleshooting skills in low stakes situations.

<img align="left" width="100" alt="HardwareX Logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mswiseman/mswiseman.github.io/master/assets/img/hardwarexlogo.gif"> [HardwareX](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/hardwarex) is a peer-reviewed open access scientific journal dedicated to the open source design and construction of scientific instrumentation. The journal publishes science hardware shared under an open source hardware license. For DIY hardware, I believe HardwareX has the most detailed manuscripts that enable easier reproducibility. <br clear="left"/><br><br>

## Hardware documentation \ [Back to top](#background)

I've included direct links to the documentation of hardware commonly used in DIY free open source hardware. This field is rapidly evolving, so I imagine this section will change frequently. 

### Microcontrollers

Microcontrollers are the brains of hardware - they tell the other components what to do. They are best suited for simple repetitive tasks (such as activating a motor). I recommend choosing a microcontroller based on your power needs, programming language preference (generally C, C++, or micropython) power, but also based on the company's reputation and the available documentation. Speaking from experience: you will save yourself *a lot of frustration* if you work with a microcontroller that has thorough documentation and support (like the Arduino series). 

#### CNC Microcontrollers
Have a task that can be programmed and contained on an X, Y, Z system? You'll probably use computer numerical control (CNC). These microcontrollers have firmware that's adapted for and commonly used in CNC applications (CNC routers, 3d printers, liquid handlers, etc.):
* [Arduino Uno (8-bit)](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3)
* [Arduino Mega (8-bit)](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/mega-2560-r3)
* [Arduino Due (32-bit)](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/due)
* [Duet2 (32-bit)](https://www.duet3d.com/DuetWifi)
* [Duet3 (32-bit](https://www.duet3d.com/Duet3Mainboard6HC)
* [Smoothieboard (32-bit)](http://smoothieware.org/)

#### Tiny Microcontrollers
These are tiny microcontrollers are well-suited for wearable, lightweight, or limited space applications. 
* [Ardunio Nano (8-bit)](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-nano)
* [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/)
* [Seeeduino XIAO](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-Arduino-Microcontroller-SAMD21-Cortex-M0+-p-4426.html)


### Microcontroller firmware
Firmware is essentially permanent software that is programmed to microcontrollers. You will need to change the firmware (or write your own) to adapt it for your application; consequently, it's wise to familiarize yourself with the available resources, formatting, and limitations of various firmware packages. Firmware is typically written in C, C++, or Micropython. The software component of DIY hardware *can be challenging*, **but** there are tools, such as integrated development environments (IDE), that can make customizing firmware fairly straightforward. Not familiar with IDE? If you have used R-Studio or Jupyter Notebook, then you have used IDEs for the R and Python, respectively. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ana1mFFMHIk) a nice overview of IDEs.

#### Most commmon microcontroller firmware packages
* [Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/)

### Mini-computers
Technically speaking, mini-computers (aka microprocessors) are not microcontrollers as they can handle multiple tasks at once. These are best suited for software-heavy applications.
