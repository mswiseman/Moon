I hope this website can be a resource for anyone looking into DIY open-source hardware or software for their research. Broadly speaking, my research involves plant sciences and pathology; consequently, resources found here will initially be focused on hardware and software relevant to the plant sciences. However, lab hardware and software often transcends disciplines, so I hope you can find useful information regardless of your field. <br><br>I am **not** an engineer and thus I have tried to tread lightly in areas for which my terminology and/or understanding may not be accurate or thorough. Sometimes exploring a new skill or field can be frustrating or intimidating, especially early in the process; to overcome this, I encourage you to seek help from people who have more experience and from the many other resources available (videos, documentation, forums, etc.). Keep in mind: nobody is all-knowing and everyone has to start somewhere; alas, let's create a collaborative and supportive DIY movement together!

## Why DIY hardware/software?

If your lab is fortunate enough to be flush with funding, you may be asking: why bother building something myself when I can pay a company to do it for me? Great question. This may not be relevant for you. However, you may still find other benefits by learning how to build hardware and software yourself. Some benefits include:

* Improving accessibility to underfunded laboratories
* Creating customization and/or automation for repetitive tasks
* Improving intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility
* Learning critical troubleshooting, coding, and electrical skills
* Building the socially-acceptable version of adult legos (okay, that's a joke)

## Resources
**Interested? in learning more? I hope so! Here are some great resources to start:**

* [Peer-reviewed scientific resources](#peer-reviewed-scienfic-resources)
* [Selected publications for inspiration](#selected-publications)
* [Documentation for commonly used hardware](#hardware-documentation)
    * [Microcontrollers](#microcontrollers)
    * [Stepper drivers](#stepper-drivers)
    * [Environmental sensors](#environmental-sensors)

## Peer-reviewed scienfic resources
<img align="left" width="100" alt="HardwareX Logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mswiseman/mswiseman.github.io/master/assets/img/hardwarexlogo.gif"> [HardwareX](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/hardwarex) is a peer-reviewed open access scientific journal dedicated to the open source design and construction of scientific instrumentation. The journal publishes science hardware shared under an open source hardware license. For DIY hardware, I believe HardwareX has the most detailed manuscripts that enable easier reproducibility. <br clear="left"/><br><br>

<img align="left" width="100" alt="Nature Scientific Reports Logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mswiseman/mswiseman.github.io/master/assets/img/ScientificReportsandNatureLogo.png"> [Nature Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/srep/) is an open access journal publishing original research from across all areas of the natural sciences, medicine and engineering. To find manuscripts more likely to have DIY hardware, I would explore the tags [*lab-on-a-chip*](https://www.nature.com/search?q=lab-on-a-chip&order=relevance&journal=srep), [*biomedical engineering*](https://www.nature.com/search?q=biomedical%20engineering&order=relevance&journal=srep), or [*mechanical engineering*](https://www.nature.com/search?q=mechanical%20engineering&order=relevance&journal=srep). <br clear="left"/><br><br>

## Hardware documentation

I've included direct links to the documentation of hardware commonly used in DIY free open source hardware. This field is rapidly evolving, so I imagine this section will change frequently. 

### Microcontrollers

Microcontrollers are the brains of hardware - they tell the other components what to do. They are best suited for singular repetitive tasks (such as activating a motor). I recommend choosing a microcontroller not only based on your power and accessory needs, but as based on the reputation and available documentation. Speaking from experience: you will save yourself a lot of frustration if you work with a microcontroller that has thorough documentation (like the Arduino series). 

#### CNC
Have a task that can be programmed and contained on an X, Y, Z system? You'll probably use computer numerical control (CNC). These microcontrollers have firmware that's adapted for and commonly used in CNC applications (CNC routers, 3d printers, liquid handlers, etc.):
* [Arduino Uno (8-bit)](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3)
* [Ardunio Nano (8-bit)](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-nano)
* [Arduino Mega (8-bit)](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/mega-2560-r3)
* [Arduino Due (32-bit)](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/due)
* [Duet2 (32-bit)](https://www.duet3d.com/DuetWifi)
* [Due5x (32-bit)[]
* [Smoothieboard (32-bit)](http://smoothieware.org/)

#### Wearable-friendly
* [Seeeduino XIAO](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-Arduino-Microcontroller-SAMD21-Cortex-M0+-p-4426.html)

### Microcontroller firmware

* [Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/)
    * [Compatible 8/16/32-bit boards](https://marlinfw.org/docs/hardware/boards.html)
* [grbl](https://github.com/grbl/grbl)
    * Compatible with Arduino Uno Stack, Arduino Nano Stack, MKS-DLC, Mega 2560 Stack
* [RepRap](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap)
    * [Compatible 8/16-bit boards](https://reprap.org/wiki/Category:8/16-bit_board)
    * [Compatible 32-bit boards](https://reprap.org/wiki/Category:32-bit_board) 
* [Smoothieware](https://smoothieware.org/)
    * Compatible with all RepRap boards

### Stepper drivers

### Environmental sensors

### Mini-computers
Technically speaking, mini-computers (aka microprocessors) are not microcontrollers as they can handle multiple tasks at once. These are best suited for software heavy applications.
