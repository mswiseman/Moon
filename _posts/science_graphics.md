On Science Communication
=======================
In part two of my science communication series, I'll talk about different options of communicating science graphically. It's hard to overstate the importance of making visually appealing infographics and figures that break down complex subjects into digestible parts.

Most researchers use powerpoint for this process because it allows you to group shapes and replicate them with simple copy-paste. Further, resizing these group objects is simply done by just clicking the group and dragging the corners. For a great post on using powerpoint to create visually appealing infographics, see [here](https://www.copypress.com/kb/infographics/how-to-make-infographics-with-powerpoint-2/).

Powerpoint is obviously a powerful and intuitive tool, but I also wanted to introduce another tool I've discovered recently: Biorender.

Didn't see that last step coming, did you? 

One of my favorite podcasts, [ShortWave](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510351/short-wave), airs easy-to-digest scientific stories all while promoting diversity and   encouraging forward-thinking. This past week, I was *thoroughly impressed* by their story on [Dr. Jess Wade](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/04/953334366/one-page-at-a-time-jess-wade-is-changing-wikipedia), an experimental physicist who writes Wikipedia pages on female and POC scientists in her spare time. At the time the story aired, Dr. Jess Wade had already written over 1200 Wikipedia pages for these underrepresented groups.

This feat is absolutely incredible and undeniabily helps uplift female and POC scientists by making their scientific achievements more accessible to the public. Go ahead and google `Rosalind Franklin`. What pops up first? 

**Wikipedia**

Bottom line: **if there is a Wikipedia page, it will usually be your top result.** This isn't unique to just biographical searches, it also applies to other important topics, such as *your research subject*. Why should you care?

The Importance of Making your Research Accessible to the Public
------

From the [ShortWave](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510351/short-wave) transcript:

>**EMILY KWONG**: Wikipedia sees *300 billion page views every day* on average and has the power to influence the direction of scientific research.
>**JESS WADE**: So *if* a research topic or a particular kind of emerging interdisciplinary area is *well written about and well documented on Wikipedia*, that will **grow and blossom**. People will be attracted to and read that.

So, trying to get that [insert obscure research subject] proposal funded? Aside from a proposal, put together a Wikipedia page, expand a current one, simplify existing language, etc. to make the information more accessable. 

Putting my money where my mouth is...

I found little or erroraneous information when I went looking for the research topics we cover in the [Gent Lab](https://gentlab.github.io). So, I made some corrections and have expanded on some articles. There will always be more to do, but it's a start! 

Of course, there are other ways to make your research more accessible including submitting to open access journals, social media, blogging, giving public talks, etc. But, in the age of CoVID-19, starting some new Wikipedia pages is an easy and safe science communication outreach option.

[So, go make some Wikipedia pages!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)
