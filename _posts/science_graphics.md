On Science Communication
=======================
In part two of my science communication series, I'll talk about different options of communicating science graphically. It's hard to overstate the importance of making visually appealing infographics and figures that break down complex subjects into digestible parts.

How are these graphics made?
------------
Most researchers use powerpoint to make figures and infographics because it allows you to group shapes and replicate them with simple copy-paste. Further, resizing these group objects is simply done by just clicking the group and dragging the corners. For a great post on using powerpoint to create visually appealing infographics, see [here](https://www.copypress.com/kb/infographics/how-to-make-infographics-with-powerpoint-2/). Like others, I have heavily relied on powerpoint for making figures in papers, making infographics, and, of course, putting together presentations. While I've had pretty good success with powerpoint, I have noticed some shortcomings of powerpoint for creation of beautiful graphics including:

1. Compatibility issues between different versions
2. Large file sizes often hinder collaboration unless stored on large-file compatible cloud storage system
3. Shapes used to make infographics are not vector-based and thus do not scale well

Nonetheless, I've learned to work with what I had (including my limited artistic abilities :smirk:) and have assembled some pretty eye catching work over the years. See below.

Alas, powerpoint is obviously a powerful and intuitive tool; however, I also want to introduce another tool I've discovered recently: [Biorender](http://www.biorender.com/). Note: this is not a paid endorsement.

Biorender is an online powerpoint-like tool that utilizes vector-based imaging, allows for cloud collaboration, **and** has thousands of pre-made scientific images, pre-made templates, and more! So, to put it bluntly, Biorender is the scientists' version of online powerpoint... but on steroids. Like powerpoint, you get the same great features that make creating infographics and figures easy such as shape grouping, group resizing, various alignment options, etc. On top of all that, you also get access to pre-made high-quality vector icons... incredible! Suddenly I'm is making material that looks like it came from an actual artist.
