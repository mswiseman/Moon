## I really enjoy combining science and graphic design

And Tableau makes this pretty darn easy. Haven't heard of it? I'm not surprised... it seems to have skipped on right over the science world and instead pretty much encompasses the business and marking sects. 

**Tableau allows you to upload your spreadsheets, use drag and drop to create visualizations, and share with a click.** Okay, okay, admittedly that's their tagline, but it's almost that good. To me, it's as kinda like Excel crossed with Powerpoint (with the old helper paperclip from MS word back in the day). 

C'mon, you remember Clippy, right?

Anyway, it's a pretty neat tool with some nice features including:
* Amazing visualization capabilities
* Fairly easy to use
* Several databases pre-loaded (like census data)
* Dashboards are mobile-friendly
* Easy to share and embed

Unfortunately, there are also some major cons, including:
* Easy to inadvertantly have version control issues
* Very expensive for non-students*
* Poor support
* Learning curve for most

*Fortunately, as a student, I don't have to pay for Tableau (yet), so that con doesn't yet apply.*

The largest concern for scientists, of course, would be version control issues. I encountered this myself before I understood how to use the software. The easy work around is to export your filtered spreadsheets, save your tableau workbook locally (with date), and to not use the online Tableau editing tool. Follow those guidelines, and that should be a problem. Of course, R is the current gold standard for reproducibility because you your colleague can just copy your code, run it, and see the same results. Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely not favoring Tableau over R; however, it is much less time consuming to create a truly stunning dashboard in Tableau than it is in R. 

So, my take away: great for *students* who need to quickly produce beautiful data visualizations.

Here's a few examples of what you can do with Tableau *note: I'm not getting paid for this, just sharing with colleagues*
