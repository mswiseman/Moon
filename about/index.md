Research Foci
------------
While pursuing my PhD in Botany and Plant Pathology at Oregon State University, I intend to focus my research on genetic mechanisms controlling plant susceptibility/resistance to disease. My primary focus will be examining differential expression of the *mlo* gene family in response to powdery mildew infection in hop. Secondary foci include examination of *s*-gene networks, functional studies of *mlo* susceptibility genes, development of susceptibility/resistance markers, and continued collaborative and/or hop grower-directed applied pathology research.
